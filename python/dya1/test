Somehow, it seems the love I knew was always the most destructive kind
不知为何，我经历的爱情总是最具毁灭性的的那种
Yesterday when I was young
昨日当我年少轻狂
The taste of life was sweet
生命的滋味是甜的
As rain upon my tongue
就如舌尖上的雨露
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game

The way the evening breeze
就如夜晚的微风
May tease the candle flame
逗弄蜡烛的火苗
The thousand dreams I dreamed
我曾千万次梦见
The splendid things I planned
那些我计划的绚丽蓝图
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
但我总是将之建筑在易逝的流沙上
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
我夜夜笙歌 逃避白昼赤裸的阳光
And only now I see how the time ran away
事到如今我才看清岁月是如何匆匆流逝
Yesterday when I was young
昨日当我年少轻狂
